## 🚀 **Ready to Execute Phase 1**

### **Immediate Action Items:**
1. **Set up Kanban Board** following [KANBAN_SETUP.md](KANBAN_SETUP.md)
2. **Assign Initial Issues** - Start with #2 and #7 (no dependencies)
3. **Begin Team Coordination** using the GitHub Issues workflow

### **Key Starting Points:**
- **Issue #2**: Design Framework-Agnostic Layer (foundational, no dependencies)
- **Issue #7**: Study kagent Architecture (research focus, no dependencies)
- **Issue #12**: Analyze AAMI Requirements (integration planning, no dependencies)

### **Dependency Flow:**
```
#2 → #3 → #4 → #5 (Architecture track)
#7 → #9 → #10 → #11 (Framework track)  
#12 → #13, #14 → #15 (AAMI track)
```
