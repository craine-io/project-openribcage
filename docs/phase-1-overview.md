# Phase 1: Foundation & Research Overview

## Duration
Weeks 1-2 (2 weeks)

## Objective
Establish the foundational architecture and research for Project Ribcage - the universal agency engine that enables framework-agnostic AI agent coordination through AAMI.

## Epics

## Phase 1 Totals
- **Total Story Points:** 63
- **Total Issues:** 12
- **Total Epics:** 3
- **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Team Size:** 4-5 people

## Key Deliverables
1. Complete Ribcage architecture design
2. Framework adapter specifications
3. AAMI integration plan
4. Agency abstraction layer design
5. Communication protocols
6. Discovery and registration systems

## Success Criteria
- All designs reviewed and approved
- Architecture supports all target frameworks (kagent, AutoGen, CrewAI, LangGraph)
- AAMI integration requirements satisfied
- Foundation ready for implementation in Phase 2

## Dependencies
- Access to kagent development environment
- AAMI design specifications
- Framework documentation and test environments

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk:** Framework research reveals incompatible patterns
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on common subset, plan framework-specific extensions
- **Risk:** AAMI requirements change during analysis
  - **Mitigation:** Maintain close communication with AAMI team, design for flexibility
- **Risk:** Performance requirements too aggressive
  - **Mitigation:** Prototype critical paths, validate assumptions early
