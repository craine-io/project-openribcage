# OpenRibcage Open Source Community Building Strategy

> Building the universal coordination layer for heterogeneous agent ecosystems

## Executive Summary

OpenRibcage is positioned to become the essential infrastructure layer for enterprise agent coordination by building a thriving community of framework adapter developers. This strategy focuses on creating the "transparent ribcage" that allows enterprises to coordinate AI agencies across any framework through a unified interface, while maintaining complete visibility into how their agents work.

**Core Community Focus**: Framework adapter developers who build connectors between OpenRibcage and various agent frameworks (kagent, n8n, CrewAI, LangGraph, etc.)

**Strategic Positioning**: The universal translator between AAMI (Avatar Agency Management Interface) and heterogeneous agent frameworks, emphasizing transparency, security, and developer experience.

## Project Context

### What OpenRibcage Does
- **Framework-Agnostic Abstraction**: Universal API layer between AAMI and any agent framework
- **Transparent Infrastructure**: "See exactly how your agents work, regardless of framework"
- **Security Integration**: Incorporates Agent Gateway patterns for enterprise-grade security
- **Unified Coordination**: Single interface for managing heterogeneous agent ecosystems

### What OpenRibcage Is NOT
- Not competing with agent frameworks (it connects them)
- Not the AAMI interface itself (AAMI is proprietary)
- Not handling MCP data flows directly (agents have direct MCP access)
